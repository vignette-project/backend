# Vignette Face Tracking

The Vignette Face Tracking backend is the core of the Vignette experience. It's responsible for tracking facial features along with the eye gaze and reflects it on a graphical interface, may it be a Live2D model or other things.


## Please be noted

Everything here is work in progress and moves fast. There will be no stability guranteed until we have decided what would be the final approach to the model.
